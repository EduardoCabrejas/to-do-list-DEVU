This project has a website still under development which offers task management services to improve the distribution and organization of tasks of its users. You must register and log in to create your tasks, change their details, mark them as completed, or delete them.

You can view your profile and its details, as well as change them.

**For the backend, use the "npm run dev" command.** If you want to test the tests it has, run "npm run test".

**For the frontend, use "npm run build"** to compile the data required to speed up site deployment. To deploy and **enter the site from your browser, run "npm run dev".**
